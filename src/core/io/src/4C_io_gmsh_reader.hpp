   * @brief Read a Gmsh `.msh` file into the 4C intermediate mesh representation.

   * and point sets. Each physical group is identified by a `(dim, tag)` pair. It is asserted that
   * physical tags are unique across dimensions.
   *
   * @subsection element_blocks Element blocks
   * For each physical group, an element block is created using the corresponding
   * (unique) tag as a key. If a physical group contains multiple element types, a warning is issued
   * and the group is excluded from the element blocks.
   *
   * @subsection point_sets Point sets
   * All physical groups (independent of their dimension) are converted into point
   * sets using the (unique) tag as a key. Point sets remain available even if the
   * corresponding physical group is excluded from the element blocks.
   *
   * @param msh_file Path to the Gmsh `.msh` file.
