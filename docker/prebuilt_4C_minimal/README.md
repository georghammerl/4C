>**Disclaimer:** this docker image is experimental. There will be modifications in the future.

This `Dockerfile` creates an docker image with a ready to use 4C executable. Compared to
`prebuilt_4C`, this image only contains the bare minimum to run 4C, so, no source, build folder,
tests, or other testing infrastructure. All optional dependencies that are compatible with 4C's
license are enabled.

This image is for you if you just want a 4C executable or want to use it as image in GitHub Actions.

The 4C executable is in `/home/user/4C/bin/4C` but can also be directly called with `4C` from
anywhere via a symlink.
